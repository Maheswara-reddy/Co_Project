# SHOULD BE CHECKED BY THE FACULTY
we created 2 lists nameky reg,mem each allocated as registers and memory respectively,as we are maping a mips archetecture we took 32 registers, and a memory size if 4096 bytes as the lists are of integer typeas we defined
we defined a function funchk, to read each line and call the function to be executed,another function called linechk reads the list elemnts which we get from funchk and allocates the register

in the maincode we used line =fp.readfile() consectively to read each line after the present line is executed,the basic requirements in assembly like ".data", etc are checked using if statements and the code only exectes only
 if the required headerfiles are called. the tough part in our code was bne and jump, to execute them we read the code once again,and see where the label is called.

we wrote each aspect required but the code was not executing in the compiler , we think the problem was in the parsing.
